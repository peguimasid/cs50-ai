=== QUESTION-1 ===

Between depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS),
which will find a shorter path through a maze?

Answer: BFS will sometimes, but not always, find a shorter path than DFS

=== QUESTION-2 ===

Consider the below maze. Grey cells indicate walls.
A search algorithm was run on this maze, and found the yellow highlighted path
from point A to B. In doing so, the red highlighted cells were the states
explored but that did not lead to the goal.

Answer: Could only be DFS

=== QUESTION-3 ===

Why is depth-limited minimax sometimes preferable to minimax without a depth limit?

Answer: Depth-limited minimax can arrive at a decision more
quickly because it explores fewer states

=== QUESTION-4 ===

Consider the Minimax tree below, where the green up arrows indicate the MAX player
and red down arrows indicate the MIN player. The leaf nodes are each
labelled with their value.

Answer: 5
