=== QUESTION-2 ===

There are other logical connectives that exist, other than the ones discussed in lecture. One of the most common is “Exclusive Or” (represented using the symbol ⊕). The expression A ⊕ B represents the sentence “A or B, but not both.” Which of the following is logically equivalent to A ⊕ B?

(A ∨ B) ∧ ¬ (A ∧ B)
(A ∧ B) ∨ ¬ (A ∨ B)
(A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∧ B)
(A ∨ B) ∧ ¬ (A ∨ B)

Answer: (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬ (A ∧ B) -> (A or B) and not(A and B)

=== QUESTION-3 ===

Let propositional variable R be that “It is raining,” the variable C be that 
“It is cloudy,” and the variable S be that “It is sunny.” 
Which of the following a propositional logic representation of the sentence
“If it is raining, then it is cloudy and not sunny.”?

---
R => It is raining
C => Is is cloudy
S => It is sunny
---

(R → C) ∧ ¬S
R → C → ¬S
R ∧ C ∧ ¬S
R → (C ∧ ¬S)
(C ∨ ¬S) → R

Answer: R → (C ∧ ¬S)

=== QUESTION-4 ===

---
∧ => AND
∨ => OR
∀x => For all values of X, the statement is gonna hold true
∃x => There exists an value X, that the statement is gonna hold true

Example:
- ∀x. Person(x) -> (∃y. House(y) ∧ BelongsTo(x, y))
- For all x, person x implies there exists an house y, that the person
  x belongs to that house y

Consider, in first-order logic, the following predicate symbols.
Student(x) represents the predicate that “x is a student.” Course(x)
represents the predicate that “x is a course.” Enrolled(x, y) represents the
predicate that “x is enrolled in y.” Which of the following is a first-order 
logic translation of the sentence:

“There is a course that Harry and Hermione are both enrolled in.”?

∃x. Course(x) ∧ Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ Enrolled(Hermione, x)
∀x. Course(x) ∧ Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ Enrolled(Hermione, x)
∃x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ ∃y. Enrolled(Hermione, y)
∀x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ ∀y. Enrolled(Hermione, y)
∃x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∨ Enrolled(Hermione, x)
∀x. Enrolled(Harry, x) ∨ Enrolled(Hermione, x)

Answer: ∃x. Course(x) ∧ Enrolled(Harry, x) ∧ Enrolled(Hermione, x)
